This repository includes a collection of Python exercises and projects aimed at enhancing programming skills.  

It covers tasks like performing basic arithmetic operations, checking palindromes, file handling, implementing CRUD operations with lists and dictionaries, and practicing object-oriented programming with a `Student` class.  
Additionally, the repository features an API development project using Flask to implement a RESTful API with CRUD operations for **movie reviews** and a frontend for user interaction.  

The machine learning project includes a regression model trained to predict car prices, which is integrated into a Flask API for real-time predictions.  
To run the code efficiently, ensure that you adjust the file paths in the scripts according to your local machine setup.  

For the Flask app, run it locally and visit the provided URL to access the movie reviews API and predictions.
